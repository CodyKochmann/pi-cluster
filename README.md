# pi-cluster

To celebrate pi day and to get a little more public in the clustering community when it comes to raspberry pi, I am putting together a raspberry pi cluster which will be live come pi day! If you have any suggestions, let hear em. If you wanna copy this and be on your way, so be it! Just know my stuff evolves fast so keep an eye on the repo after you do. :)
