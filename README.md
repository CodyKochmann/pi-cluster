# pi-cluster

To celebrate pi day and to get a little more public in the clustering community when it comes to raspberry pi, I am putting together a raspberry pi cluster which will be live come pi day! If you have any suggestions, let hear em. If you wanna copy this and be on your way, so be it! Just know my stuff evolves fast so keep an eye on the repo after you do. :)

### Layout of this repo

This repo is split into two sections to make it so those who just want the deatils on one side of the build can have what they need and leave but also to make a clean seperation of the two pieces of nature that is this computer science project.
