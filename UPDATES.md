# Updates

> Instead of going with a change log where all changes are being discussed as time goes on, I'm having this be where the news will be in terms of what's changing. 
> 
> Not everything is set in stone and certain parts of this project are changingentirely purely because I would later be informed that there is a better way to approach something. I don't have a problem with changing something entirely because evolution of software has offered a better solution. What I do mind though is not keeping everyone up to date on what's actually changing and why so thats why this exists.

- NO MORE CARDBOARD!!! (hardware)
  > Currently, the entire hardware setup is being held together with cardboard. After using a laser thermometer and realizing that the pis don't pass around 110 degrees, cardboard became a good prototyping platform.

  > It is though, time for a upgrade. The final model will be made of aluminum but for version 2, wood is the next stepping stone.
